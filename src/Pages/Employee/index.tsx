              Facing immigration or permanent resident challenges in the US?

            <Font className="pt-5">
              Canada may be the answer to your immigration dilemma – and your
              career dreams. The reality of the H-1B immigration situation in
              the US is that many more candidates will apply than those who will
              get selected. Unfortunately, after finding your dream job and
              starting a life in the US, losing out on the lottery means that
              you will not have a chance to work and live in the US long-term.
              Fortunately, there’s a job explosion happening in Canada, that you
              can take advantage of.
