              Path to Canada has played a huge role in recruiting and hiring top
              talent to meet the needs of growing technology companies in
              Canada. Companies like yours all over the country are experiencing
              unprecedented growth, and unfortunately, a corresponding tech
              shortage.

              Did you know that Canada has a secret weapon to acquire tech
              talent – Global Talent Stream, the best work visa program in the
              world? We can help you use this program to acquire highly-skilled
              tech talent from around the world and the US and bring them to
              Canada permanently in less than 90 days.
